<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
<br>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet popular two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is for one player to place three of their symbols (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before their opponent does.
<h3>Game Components:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Players:</b> There are two players, one using the symbol "X" and the other using the symbol "O." </li>
  <li><b>Game Board:</b> The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, making a total of 9 empty spaces.</li>
  <li><b>Symbols:</b> Players take turns placing their symbol (either "X" or "O") in one of the empty spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Game Objective:</h3>
The goal for each player is to form a straight line of three of their own symbols, either:
<ul>
  <li>Horizontally (all three in the same row),</li>
  <li>Vertically (all three in the same column), or</li>
  <li>Diagonally (either from the top left to bottom right or top right to bottom left).</li>
</ul>
